# Programming_Language
 Created a Programming Language using Python

1. Created a Lexer to generate Tokens
2. Created a Parser to parse the Tokens by building a grammer tree based on grammar rules from grammar.txt 
3. Created an Interpreter to parse the Abstract Syntax Tree
4. Created a Symbol Tree to store and edit variables


Declare a variable using the VAR keyword eg: VAR a = 10

IF statements work as follows. IF statements are expressions by default.

IF <condition> 
	THEN <expression>
ELIF <condition>
	THEN <expression>
ELSE
	<expression>
